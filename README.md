# Computer System Projects
Three small projects written in C that demonstrate an understanding of computer systems, specifically cache implementation, system commands, and memory allocation
1. Memory allocation using a BST (memory_alloc)  
   - This program essentially user to request a certain number of bytes, which will then be malloced accordingly. The program includes capabilities that allow for memory to be compacted or split based on the number of bytes required.
2. Cache simulator (cache_simulator)
   - A cache simulator that mimics the processes that happend when memory is loaded, saved, or modified based on instructions from a trace file. 
3. Writing our own Unix shell (unix_shell)  
   - A basic unix shell that includes my own implementation of a few built-in functions using system calls, as well as allowing for users to execute regular shell commands implemented through fork() and execv().
